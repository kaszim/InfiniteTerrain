# InfiniteTerrain

An old project that showcases an infinite 2d terrain with collision detection. It uses shaders to remove and add terrain, which makes it very fluent. The collision map is calculated realtime using an quad tree.
Perlin noise is used to generate the terrain, with two versions, one that runs on the gpu which is very fast and one on the cpu. This game was supposed to be some kind of 2d miner.
